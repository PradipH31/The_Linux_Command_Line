The file /etc/fstab lists the devices(typically hard disk partitions) that will be mounted at boot time
The 6 fields in the /etc/fstab file are
Field Contents          Description
1     Device            Traditionally, this contains the actual name of a device
                        file associated with the physical device, like /dev/sda1
                        (the first partition of the first detected hard disk) But
                        with today's computers, which have many devices that are
                        hot pluggable(USBs), many modern Linux distros associate
                        a device with a text label instead. This label(added to
                        storage media when it is formatted) can be a simple text
                        or a randomly generated UUID(Universally Unique Identifier)
                        The label is read by the OS when the device is attached to
                        the system. This way, no matter which device file is
                        assigned to the actual physical device, it can still be
                        correctly identified
2     Mount point       The directory where the device is attached to the file 
                        system tree
3     File system type  Linux allows many file system types to be mounted. Most
                        native Linux file systems are Fourth Extended File System 
                        (ext4), but others are also supported. like FAT16(msdos),
                        FAT32(vfat), NTFS(ntfs), CD-ROM(iso9660),etc
4     Options           File systems can be mounted with options like read-only or
                        prevent any programs from being executed from them(security)
5     Frequency         A single number that specifies if and when a file system is
                        to be backed up with the dump command
6     Order             A single number that specifies in what order file systems 
                        should be checked with the fsck commmand

Viewing Mounted File Systems
mount
    used to mount file systemns
    Entering without arguments displays the file systems currently mounted
The format is [device] on [mount_point] type [filesystem_type] (options)
              /dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro)

Unmounting file systems or devices
umount device_mounted_location

Mounting file systems or devices
mount mount_location /mnt/device_name
    If mounted on a non-empty directory, the previous contents won't be accessible until the device is unmounted
    mount -t iso9660 /dev/sdc /mnt/cdrom
        t option is for type and iso9660 is for CD-ROM

Determining Device Names
    Getting some ideas from /dev
            Linux Storage Device Names
    Pattern     Device
    /dev/fd*    Floppy disk drives
    /dev/hd*    IDE(PATA) disks on older systems. Typical motherboards contain 2 IDE
                connectors or channels, each with a cable with 2 attachment points 
                for drives. The first drive on the cable is called the master device
                and the second is called the slave device. The device names are 
                ordered such that /dev/hda refers to master device on the first 
                channel, /dev/hdb is the slave device on the first channel; /dev/hdc
                is the master device on the second channel, and so on. A trailing
                digit indicates the partition number on the device. For example.
                /dev/hda1 refers to first partition on the first hard drive on the
                system, while /dev/hda refers to the entire drive
    /dev/lp*    Printers
    /dev/sd*    SCSI disks. On modern Linux systems, the kernel treats all disk-like
                devices(including PATA/SATA hard disks, flash drives, and USB mass
                storage devices such as portable music players and digital cameras)
                as SCSI disks. The rest of the naming system is similar to the older
                /dev/hd* naming scheme
    /dev/sr*    Optical drives(CD/DVD readers and burners)
Symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom, /dev/dvd, and /dev/dvd which point to actual device files provide convenience

Determining Device Names on a System without automount
    interactively tail /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog
        sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
    Plug in the removable media
    Almost immediately, the kernel will notice the device and probe it
    After the display pauses again, Ctrl-C
    THe interesting parts of the output are the repeated references to [sd/hd/lp,etc]
    This tells the device name and the partition name if any
    Mount the device
