If we treat a disk drive as simply a large collection of data blocks, we could perform useful tasks, such as cloning devices

The dd program performs this task
It copies blocks of data from one place to another

dd(data definition/destroy disk)
    dd if=input_file of=output_file [bs=block_size [count=blocks]]

    If we have 2 USBs of same size and wanted to clone one to another(sdb and sdc)
        dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/sdc
            If only one device was connected, we could copy the contents to a file for later copyinh
            dd if=/dev/sdb of=flash_drive.img


Creating CD-ROM images
    Writing a recordable CD-ROM (either a CD-R or CD-RW) consists of 2 steps
        Creating an ISO image file that is the exact file system image of the CD-ROM
        Writing the image file onto the CD-ROM media

Creating an Image Copy of a CD-ROM
Making an iso image of an existing CD-ROM in a local file
    dd if=/dev/cdrom of=ubuntu.iso

Creating an Image from a Collection of Files
To create a iso containing contents of a directory, we use geniso command
    geniso -o cd-rom.iso -R -J ~/cd-rom-files
        -R      adds metadata for Rock Ridge extensions, allowing use of long filenames and POSIX-style file permissions
        -J      enables Joliet extensions, permitting long filenames for Windows

Writing CD-ROM Images
Mounting an ISO Image Directly
We can mount an ISO image that we have on our hard disk(this means that we have already created an iso file) and treat it as an optical media
    mount -t iso9660 -o loop image.iso /mnt/iso_image
Remember to unmount

Blanking a Rewritable CD-ROM
Rewritable CD-ROM media needs to be erased or blanked before it can be reused
We need to specify the device name and the type of blanking to perform(most common is fast)
    wodim dev=/dev/cdrw blank=fast

Writing an Image
wodim dev=/dev/cdrw image.iso

Verifying integrity of an ISO image
The most common method of checksum generation is md5sum program
    md5sum image.iso
