ping
    sends an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to a specified host
    Most networking devices will reply to it
        ping linuxcommand.org
    ping sends packets at a specified interval (1 second default) until it is interrupted
    After interruption, ping prints the performance statistics
        A properly performing network exhibits 0 percent packet loss

traceroute/tracepath
    lists all the hops network traffic takes to get from the local system to a specified host
        traceroute slashdot.org
    We can see number of routers traversed
    Routers that provide identifying information give hostnames, IP address and performance data
    Routers that don't provide information give **
        In cases routing information is blocked, we can overcome either by -T or -I

ip
    makes use of the full range of networking features available in modern Linux kernels
    We can examine a system's network interfaces and routing table
        ip a
            We see that our test system has 2 network interfaces
            The first, called lo, is the loopback interface, a virtual interface that the system uses to talk to itself, and the second, eth0 is the Ethernet interface
    When performing casual network diagnostics, the important things to look for are presence of the word UP in the first line for each interface, indicating that the network interface is enabled, and the presence of a valid IP address in the inet field on the third line
    For systems usign DHCP, a valid IP address in this field will verify that DHCP is working

netstat
    used to examine various network settings and statistics
    Using -ei, we can examine the network interfaces in our system
    Using -r displays the kernel's network routing table
