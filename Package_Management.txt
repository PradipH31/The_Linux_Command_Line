Major Packaging Systems
    Debain-style(.deb)
        Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Raspbian
    Red Hat-style (.rpm)
        Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise, OpenSUSE

Package File is the basic unit of software in a packaging system
    -a compressed collection of files that comprise the software package
    -includes metadata about package, such as text description and contents of the package, pre- and post-installation scripts
    -created by the package maintainer
        -gets the source code from upstream provider(author), compiles, and creates metadata and required files

Repositories contain packages to be made available to users
    Different repositories exist for different stages of development(testing, development, etc)
    Repositories for 3rd party software

Programs rely on shared libraries, called dependencies

Package management usually consist of 2 types of tools
    Low-level(handle installing and removing package files)
    High-level(metadata search and dependency resolution)
        Distribution    Low-level tools     High-level tools
        Debain based    dpkg                apt-get, apt, aptitude
        Red-Hat based   rpm                 yum, dnf
