chmod
    Change permissions
    chmod octal_permission file
    chmod symbol file
        symbols:u,g,o,a = r/w/x or u,g,o,a +/- r/w/x

umask
    View default permission to be removed from a new file
    Set default permissions with umask permission
    The mask is in 4 digits octal format
        The last 3 digits are for the permissions of owner, group and others
        The first digit represents special permissions like setuid(4000), setgid(2000), sticky(1000) which prevents users other than su, owner to delete or rename files in a directory
    The execute permission is always off

Changing Identities
    su -l user
        Change the current user to user and cd to user's home
        Doesn't work in Ubuntu for root
        su -c 'command'

    sudo 
        Execute a command as another user
        Requires the user's password, not root password
        sudo -i
            Load an interactive shell as root
        sudo -l
            View the commands current user can execute as root

chown user:group file
    Change ownership
        user
        user:group
        :group      Change the group to group
        user:       Change the user to user & group to login group of user

A Practical Example
    Creating a shared folder
        Steps:
            Create a group named music
            sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/music
            sudo chown :music /usr/local/share/music
            sudo chmod 775 /usr/local/share/music
            sudo chmod g+s /usr/local/share/music
                Sets the group of the files created to be music
            umask 0002 for both users
                Default mask will be 0022, rendering group members unable to make changes to the files

passwd
    Changes password of current user or specified user
