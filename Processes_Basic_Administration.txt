Multitasking is the illusion of doing more than 1 things at once, 

ps
    Fields are PID, TTY(teletype-controlling terminal), TIME(CPU time consumed by the process) 
    ps x
        Shows all processes regardless of which or any terminal they are controlled by
        New field is the stat(state)
            R   running or ready to run    
            S   sleeping(not running, waiting for an event)
            D   uninterruptible sleep(waiting for I/O such as disk space)
            T   stopped(instructed to stop)
            Z   zombie process(terminated child process not cleaned by parent)
            <   high priority process 
            N   low priority process
        ps aux
            Also shows all processes belonging to every user
            New fileds:
                USER    User ID
                %CPU    CPU usage in percent
                %MEM    Memory usage in percent
                VSZ     Virtual memory size
                RSS     Resident Set Size(physical memory in kb)
                START   Time when the process started

Controlling Processes
    Ctrl-C  Interrupt the program
            Politely asking the program to terminate
    program &
        Put the program in background
        jobs
            View the programs in background
        fg %1
            Return the first job(background process) to foreground
            %1 is the jobspec

Stopping/Pausing a Process
    Ctrl-Z
        Stop a foreground process and place it in background
    bg %1
        Resume program execution in background
    fg
        Continue program execution in foreground

Signals
    kill PID
        kills the program
        kill command sends signals
    Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z are signals
    Ctrl-C  INT(interrupt)
    Ctrl-Z  TSTP(terminal stop)
    kill command is used to send signals to programs
        kill -signal PID
        With no specified signal, kill sends TERM(terminate)
        signal can be number or name, including name prefixed with SIG
Common Signals
    Number  Name    Meaning
    1       HUP     Hang up. Indicate a program that a controlling terminal has hung up.
                    When a terminal is closed, the foreground programs will be sent the signal and will terminate
                    When a daemon receives the signal, it will restart and reread its configuration file
    2       INT     Interrupt(same as Ctrl-C)
                    Usually terminate a program
    9       KILL    The signal is not sent to the program
                    Kernel immediately terminates the process
    15      TERM    Terminate(default signal by kill command)
                    If a program is still alive enough to receive signals, it will terminate
    19      STOP    Cause a process to pause without termination
                    Sent similar to kill
    20      TSTP    Terminal stop(Ctrl-Z)
                    It is received by the program, and the program may choose to ignore it
    3       QUIT    Quit
    11      SEGV    Segmentation violation
                    Sent when program makes illegal use of memory
    28      WINCH   Window change(programs like top, less)
                    When windows changes, the programs will redraw
kill -l
    View signals

killall -u user -signal name
    Send signals to multiple processes

Shutting Down the System
    halt
    poweroff
    reboot
    shutdown
        shutdown -h(halt)/-r(reboot)/-p(poweroff) time

Some Process-Related Commands
pstree
    Shows a process list arranged in a tree-like pattern showing parent-child relationship
vmstat
    Snapshot of system resource
    vmstat 5
        in 5 second interval
xload
    Graph showing system load over time in a GUI
tload
    Similar to xload but in terminal
