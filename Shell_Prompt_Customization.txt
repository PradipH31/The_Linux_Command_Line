Our default prompt looks like
[me@linuxbox ~]$
This is defined by an environment variable PS1(prompt string 1)
    echo $PS1
    Most important bits are
        [\u@\h \W]$

Color
    Color is set by sending terminal an ANSI escape code in the characters to be displayed
    The control code is interpreted as an instruction with \[ and \]
    ANSI escape code begins with octal 033(ESC key), followed by an optional character attribute, followed by an instruction
    \033[0;30m sets the text color to normal(attribute 0),black

Moving the Cursor
    Commonly used to provide a clock or other information at a different location on the screen
        Escape Sequences
    Escape Code     Action
    \033[1;ch       Move cursor to line 1 and column ch
    \033[nA         Move cursor up n lines
    \033[nB         Move cursor down n lines
    \033[nC         Move cursor forward n characters
    \033[nD         Move cursor backward n characters
    \033[2J         Clear screen and move cursor to upper-left corner(line 0, column 0)
    \033[K          Clear from cursor position to end of current line
    \033[s          Store current cursor position
    \033[u          Recall stored cursor position
        Constructing a prompt that shows time at the top
        PS1="\[\033[s\033[0;0H\033[0;41m\033[K\033[1;33m\t\033[0m\033[u\]<\u@\h \W>\$ "
            \t  Displays the current time
                It is included in the non-printing portion of the prompt since we don't want bash to include the clock when calculating the true size of the displayed prompt

Saving the Prompt
    Add the following line to .bashrc
    PS1="whatever your details"
    export PS1
