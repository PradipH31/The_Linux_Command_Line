Keeping directories synchronized with other directories on the local or remote system
The preferred tool is rsync
rsync
    Usage
        rsync options source destination
            where source and destination can be
                a local file or directory
                a remote file or directory in the form of [user@]host:path
                a remote rsync server specified with a URI of rsync://[user@]host[:port]/path
            remote-to-remote copying is not supported
        rsync -av playground foo
            This copies the directory playground to foo, if we add /, it will copy the contents of the directory only
            -a      for archiving-causes recursion and preservation of file attributes
        If we run the command again, we see no files have been copied as rsync detected no differences between playground and foo

    Practical Example
        Backing up from system to external dirve
            mkdir /media/BigDisk/backup
            sudo rsync -av --delete /etc /home /usr /local /media/BigDisk/backup
                --delete remvoes files that may have existed on the destination but not on the source

    Usage over network
        2 methods
            1st
                another system that has rsync installed and remote shell such as ssh
                Assuming a folder backup on the another system
                sudo rsync -av --delete --rsh=ssh /etc /home /usr/local remote-sys:/backup
                        --rsh=ssh instructs rsync to use ssh as remote shell
                        remote host has been specified
            2nd
                using an rsync server
                rsync can be configured to listen as a daemon
                often done to allow mirroring of a remote system
                Example
                    Duke University keeps a local mirror of Fedora packages
                    Using rsync to mirror their contents
                        mkdir fedora-devel
                        rsync --av -delete rsync://archive.linux.duke.edu/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Everything/x86_64/os fedora-devel
                            Here, the protocol used is rsync
                            Remote hostname is archive.linux.duke.edu
