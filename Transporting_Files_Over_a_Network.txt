ftp
    used to communicate with FTP servers, machines that contain files that can be uploaded and downloaded over a network
    is insecure because it sends account names and passwords in cleartext
    So, all FTP done over the internet is done by anonymous servers
        anonymous server allows anyone to login using the name "anonymous" and a meaningless password
                    Using a ftp server
    ftp ftp_server
    Name:   anonymous
    Password:   anything(some servers want it in the form of an email address)
    cd directory_to_download_from
    ls
    lcd Downloads
        Change local directory to Downloads
    get file
    bye

wget
    wget url
