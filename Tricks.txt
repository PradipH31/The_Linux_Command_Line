If we need to truncate a file,
    > file
tty - teletype
pstree
While using xargs,
    Linux accepts newline characters and embedded spaces as part of a filename(which will be delimted and interpreted differently in xargs)
    So, use -print0 with find to use null character as argument separator
        and --null with xargs to set nill character as argument separator
