The shell refers to the terminal
bash is a shell program from GNU Project
We use terminal emulator to interact with the shell
A shell prompt typically includes username@machinename followed by the current working directory and a $
If the last character of the prompt is #, the terminal has superuser privileges
The up arrow key shows the command history

Some commands
date shows date
cal  shows calendar
df   shows free space on the disk
du   shows memory usage
exit exit the terminal session (also with CTRL-D)
pwd     print working directory
ls      list contents of directory
cd      change the working directory

ls accepts multiple arguments for multiple locations

Commands are followed by options and that modify their behavior and further by one or more arguments, the items upon which the command acts

ls -lt
    Sort the listed files according to the modification time
    --reverse

file
    Determine the type of a file

less
    Views content of a file
    b       Scroll back 1 page
    space   Scroll forward 1 page
    G       Move to the end of file
    g 1G    Move to the beginning of file
    /abc    Seach forward to the next occurence of abc
    n       Search for next occurence of the previous search
 
Symbolic links are represented by l in the first letter
They are used for programs that have frequent version updates

Copying html files that do not exist on the destination
cp -u *.html destination

Wildcards
*               Matches any characters
?               Matches any single character
[characters]    Matches any character that is a member of the set characters
[!characters]   Matches any character that is not a member of the set characters
[[:class:]]     Matches any character that is a member of the class
Classes
[:alnum:]       Alphanumeric character class
[:alpha:]       Alphabetic character class
[:digit:]       Numbers class
[:lower:]       Lowercase character class
[:upper:]       Uppercase character class

Useful commands:
mkdir
cp
   -i       interactive
   -u       unique
   -a       preserves the attributes and copies recursively
   -r       recursive copying
mv
    After the mv is done, the original file no longer exists
rm
    Removes a file or directory
ln
    Creates symbolic links or hard links

    ln -s item file2
        Creates symbolic link of file or directory
        Use relative path if the symbolic link will be on the same directory tree as moving the directory will not disturb the link, else use absolute path
        While using relative paths for symbolic links, use the relative path of the destination of the link
        Symbolic links create a file that contains a text pointer to the referenced file or directory
        If the file pointed by symbolic link is deleted, the link is said to be broken
        Symbolic links span partitions and can refer directory

    ln file1 file2
        Creates hard link
        Hard links create an additional directory entry for a file
        Inode of a hard link is the actual pointer to the file
        So, 2 files with same inode are the hard links of the file
        To view inodes,
            ls -i
        A file will be delted and its space deallocated when it has 0 hard links

Types of commands
    Executable
        Compiled binaries or scripts
    Commands built into shell
        Like cd, internal built-in shell commands
    Shell functions
        Miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment
    Alias
        Commands built from other commands

Identifying the type of command
    type command

Displaying an executable's location
    which command
    It only works for executables

Getting a Command's Documentation
    For shell builtins:
        help command
    For executables:
        command --help
        man command
            man man to view sections of man pages
    Man pages based on a search term
        apropos searchterm
        man -k searchterm
    1-line man page description
        whatis command
    Info entry
        Info is a GNU alternative to man
        info package
            Example:info coreutils
    Program Documentation Files
        Many software packages have documentation files in /usr/share/doc

Combining commands
    command; command; command
    Example: cd /usr; ls

Alias
    Before using alias, use type to check if the alias name is available
    alias alias_name='string/commands'
Removing alias
    unalias alias_name
Aliases defined on the command line vanish when the shell session ends
