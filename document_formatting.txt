2 main families of document formatters dominate the field:
	descended from the original roff program, nroff and troff
	based on TEX typesetting system
	
	nroff is used to format documents for output to devices that use monospaced fonts
	troff is used to format documents for output on typesetters, devices used to produce "camera-ready" type for commercial printing
	roff also includes eqn for mathematical equations and tbl for tables

groff
	a suite of programs containing GNU implementation of troff

	man page lives in /usr/share/man directory as a gzip-compressed text file
	Examining uncompressed contents,
		zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | head
	We see markup components in the file
	man pages are rendered by groff, using the mandoc macro package
	Using groff to simulate the man command
		zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | groff -mandoc -T ascii | head
	Here, we use groff with options set to specify the mandoc macro package and output driver for ASCII
	groff can produce output in several formats, if no format is speicifed, PostScript is output by default


PostScript is a page description language that is used to describe the contents of a printed page to a typesetter-like device
If we take output of our command and store it in a file, we can access it with okular or other programs
	zcat /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz | groff -mandoc > ~/Desktop/ls.ps

Convert the PostScript file to a PDF
	ps2pdf ~/Desktop/ls.ps ~/Desktop/ls.pdf


We are going to use groff and tbl to format tables to typeset distros.txt
using sed script to add markup to text stream
	adding necessary markup elements(requests)

					distros-tbl.sed
# sed script to produce Linux distribution report

	tbl uses .TS and .TE requests to start and end the table
	The rows following .TS request define global properties of the table, which, above, are centered horizontally on the page and surrounded by a box
	The remaining lines of the definition describe the layout of each table row

	Usage:
		sort -k 1,1 -k 2n distros.txt | sed -f distros-tbl.sed | groff -t -T ascii
			-t instructs groff to preprocess the text stream with tbl
			-T instructs groff to output to ASCII rather than default medium, PostScript
		sort -k 1,1 -k 2n distros.txt | sed -f distros-tbl.sed | groff -t > ~/Desktop/distros.ps
