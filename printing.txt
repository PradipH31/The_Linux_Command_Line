Sending a Pring Job to a Printer
	2 methods:
	LPD(used in Berkeley Software Distribution of Unix)
		lpr
			ls /usr/bin | pr -3 | lpr
				Sends to default printer
			ls /usr/bin | pr -3 | lpr -P printer_name
				Send to printer_name
		lpstat -a
			list of printers known to system
						Common lpr Options
		Option		Description
		-n number	Set number of copies to number
		-p			Print each page with a shaded header with date, time, job name, and 
					page number
		-P printer	Specify the name of printer used for output
		-r			Delete files after printing, would be useful for programs that produce
					temporary printer-output files

	SysV(from System V version of Unix)
		lp
						Common lp options
		Option			Description
		-d printer			Set destination(printer) to printer, if none is specified, default
							printer is used
		-n number			Set number of copies to number
		-o landscape		Set output to landscape orientation
		-o fitplot			Scale the file to fit the page, useful when printing images
		-o scaling=n		Scale file to n, value of 100 fills the page
							Values less than 100 are reduced, greater than 100 cause printing
							across multiple pages
		-o cpi=number		Set output characters per inch to number(default is 10)
		-o lpi=number		Set output lines per inch to number(default is 6)
		-o page-bottom=p	Set page margins, values are expressed in points,a unit of
		-o page-left=p		typographic measurement
		-o page-right=p		There are 72 points to an inch
		-o page-top=p	
		-P pages			Specify list of pages, may be expressed as a comma-separated
							list and/or a range
			
			Usage:
				ls /usr/bin | pr -4 -2 90 -l 88 | lp -o page-left=36 -o cpi=12 -o lpi=8
					prints 12 CPI and 8 LPI with a left margin of 1 half inch
	
	a2ps
		format conversion program, ASCII to PostScript
		sends default output to the system's default printer rather than stdout
		improves the appearance of output
		Usage:
			ls /usr/bin | pr -3 -t | a2ps -o ~/Desktop/ls.ps -L 66
				-L to specify lines per page to match the output pagination of pr
		The default output layout is two-up format, causing contents of 2 pages to be pritned on each sheet of pater
		There are many options to use with this tool


Monitoring & Controlling Print Jobs
	CUPS supplies several command-line programs that are used to manage printer status and print queues
	lpstat
		used to determine the names and availability of printers on the system
			lpstat -a
			lpstat -s
							Common lpstat Options
		Option				Description
		-a [printer]		Display state of printer queue for printer
		-d					Display the name of the system's default printer
		-p [printer]		Display status of specified printer
		-r					Display the status of the print server
		-s					Display a status summary
		-t					Display a complete status report
	lpq
		view status of printer queue and print jobss
			lpq
	lprm/cancel
		CUPS supplies 2 programs to terminate print jobs and remove them from print queue
		lprm(Berkeley style)
		cancel(System V style)
			cancel 603
