Comparing text
    comm
        compares 2 files and displays the lines that are unique to each one and the lines they have in common
        produces output in 3 columns, 1st(unique to first file), 2nd(unique to second file), 3rd(common)
        Option
            -n      Suppress 1 or multiple columns
        Usage:
            cat > file1.txt
            a
            b
            c
            d
            cat > file2.txt
            b
            c
            d
            e
            comm file1.txt file2.txt

    diff
        used to detect differences between files
        often used to examine changes between different versions of program source code and has ability to recursively examine directories of source code(source trees)
        used to create diff files or patches used by programs such as patch to convert 1 version of a file/s to another version

        Output
            a terse description of differences between 2 files
            default format: group of change are preceded by a change command in the form of range operation range to describe the positions and types of changes required to convert the first file to the second file
                Change commands
                Change      Description
                r1ar2       Append the lines of the poition r2 in the second file to the position r1
                            in the first file
                r1cr2       Change (replace) the lines at position r1 with the lines at the position
                            r2 in the second file
                r1dr2       Delete the lines in the first file at position r1, which would have
                            appeared at range r2 in the second file
        Usage
            diff file1.txt file2.txt
            1d0
            < a
            4a4
            > e
        
        default format is not used widely
        popular formats are context format (-c) and unified format (-u)
                                    Context Format
        diff -c file1.txt file2.txt
            The output begins with names of 2 files and their timestamps
            first file is marked with asterisks, and second with dashes
            groups of changes, including defailt number of surrounding context lines is shown
            Example:in first group,
                *** 1,4 ***
                    indicating lines 1-4 in first flie
                later
                --- 1,4 ---
                    indicating lines 1-4 in second file
            Within change group, lines begin with either of the indicators below
                Indicator   Meaning
                blank       A line shown for context, doesn't indicate a difference between 2 files
                -           A line deleted, will appear in the first file but not in second flie
                +           A line added, will appear in the second file but not in first file
                !           A line changed, 2 versions will be displayed, each in its respective section of change group
                                    Unified Format
        diff -u file1.txt file2.txt
            similar to context format, but more concise
            different from context with elimination of duplicated lines of context
            we see filestamps like those of the context format, followed by string @@ -1,4 +1,4  @@
                indicates the lines in the first file and lines in the second file described in change group
            then the lines themselves, with default 3 lines of contexot
            lines start with one of 3 possibel characters
                Character       Meaning
                blank           shared by both files
                -               removed from first file
                +               line added to first file

    patch
        used to apply changes to text files
        accepts output from diff and is generally used to convert older-version files into newer versoin
        Example
            While developing Linux kernel, one contributor makes a small changes
            the whole kernel is not sent, rather the diff file is sent
            the receiver use patch program to apply changes to own source tree
        
        Tp prepare a diff file for use with patch, GNU suggests:
            diff -Naur old_file new_file > diff_file

        Usage:
            patch < diff_file

        Example:
            diff -Naur file1.txt file2.txt > patchfile.txt
            patch < patchfile.txt
