aspell
    an interactive spelling checker
    mostly used by other programs that require spellchecking capability, it can also be used as a stand-alone tool
    Usage:
        aspell check textfile
    Example:
        cat > fool.txt
        The quick brown fox jimped over the lazy dog
        aspell check fool.txt
    interactive in check mode
        incorrect spelled word highlighted
        middle, 10 spelling suggestions numbered 0-9, followed by list of other possible actions
        bottom, prompt ready to accept our choice
    if we replace the incorrect word, aspell moves on to next mispelled word
    after final replacement, aspell terminates and we can see that incorrect spellings have been corrected
    unless told otherwise with options, --dont-backup, aspell creates a backup file containing original text by appending .bak extensino to filename

Using sed to put back our mistakes:
    sed -i 's/lazy/laxy/; s/jumped/jimped/' foo.txt
        -i tells sed to edit file in-place, meaning instead of sending output to stdout, it will rewrite the file with changes applied
        we can add more commands with semicolon

aspell with HTML files
    aspell check file
        HTML tags will be interpreted as misspelled
    aspell -H file
        for HTML files
