tr
    used to transliterate characters
    character-based search-and-replace operation
    Example
        echo "lowercase letters" | tr a-z A-Z
        LOWERCASE LETTERS
    operates on stdin & results to stdout
    accepts 2 arguments: a set of characters to convert from and a corresponding set of characters to convert to
    Character sets may be expressed in either ways
        An enumerated list:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
        A character range:A-Z
        POSIX character classes:[:upper:]
    In most cases, both character sets should be of equal length
        it is possible for first set to be larger than the second, if we want to convert multiple characters to a single charcter
            echo"lowercase letters" | tr [:lower:] A
            AAAA

    allows characters to simply be deleted from input stream
    Example: converting DOS files to UNIX files(carriage return characters need to be removed from end of each line)
        tr -d '\r' dos_file > unix_file

    delete repeated instances of a character
        echo "aaaabbbbcccc" | tr -s ab
        abcccc
        repeated characters must be adjoining

ROT13
    echo "abc" | tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M
