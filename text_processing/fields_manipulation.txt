cat
    cat has a number of options, used to help better visualize text content
    -A displays non-printing characters in the text like tabs and carriage returns, often presented as end of line in MS-DOS-style text flies and trailing spaces in text
    Creating a file using cat:
        cat > filename
        type the text ENTER then CTRL-D
    cat -A filename
        tab character in our text is represented by ^I(CTRL-I), which is the same as a tab character
        $ appears at the true end of the line, indicating any presence of trailing spaces
    -n  numbers the lines
    -s  suppresses output of multiple blank lines

uniq
    removes any duplicate lines from a sorted file and sends the results to stdout
    often used in conjunction with sort to clean the output of duplicates
    only removes duplicates that are adjacent to each other
    Common uniq options
        Option  Long option         Description
        -c      --count             Output a list of duplicate lines preceded by the number of times
                                    the line occurs
        -d      --repeated          Output only repeated lines, rather than unique lines
        -f n    --skip-fields=n     Ignore n leading fields in each line. Fields are separated by
                                    whitespace as they are in sort; however, unlike sort, uniq has
                                    no option for setting an alternate field separator
        -i      --ignore-case       Ignore case during the line comparisons
        -s n    --skip-chars=n      Skip(ignore) the leading n characters of each line
        -u      --unique            Output only unique lines

Slicing & Dicing
    cut
        used to extract a section of text from a line and output the extracted section to a stdout
        can accept multiple file arguments or input from stdin
        cut Selection Options
            Option      Long Option         Description
            -c list     --characters=list   Extract the portion of line defined by list(may consist
                                            1 or more comma-separated numerical ranges)
            -f list     --fields=list       Extract 1 or more fields from the line as defined by 
                                            list(may contain 1 or more fields or field range 
                                            separated by commas)
            -d delim    --delimeter=delim   When -f is specified, use delim as the field delimiter
                                            By default, fields must be separated by a single tab
                        --complement        Extract the entire line of text, except for those 
                                            portions specified by -c and/or -f
        cut is best used to extract text from files that are produced by other programs
        Viewing distros.txt with cat -A
            cat -A distros.txt
        If no spaces and delimited by single tab characters
        Because the file uses tabs rather than spaces, we'll use the -f option to extract a field  
            cut -f 3 distros.txt

        Our distros file is tab-delimited, so it is best to use cut to extract fields rather than characters
        When a file is tab-delimited, it is unlikely that each line will contain the same number of characters, which makes calculating character positions within the line difficult or impossible
        From the above code, we have a field that luckily contains data of identical length
        Extracting the year from each line
            cut -f 3 distros.txt | cut -c 7-10
                We cut characters 7 through 10

    Specifying different field delimiter rather than tab
        cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/passwd | head
Note: To expand tabs into spaces,
    expand distros.txt | cut -c 23-

    paste
        adds 1 or more columns of text to a file
        reads multiple files and combines the fields found in each file to a single stream of stdout
        Usage Preparation
            sort -k 3.7 -nbr -k 3.1 -nbr -k 3.4 -nbr distros.txt > distros-by-date.txt
            cut -f 1,2 distros-by-date.txt > distros-versions.txt
            cut -f 3 distros-by-date.txt > distros-dates.txt
        Usage:
            paste distros-dates.txt distros-versions.txt

    join
        joins data from multiple files based on a shared key field
        join is an opeartion associated with relational databases where data from multiple tables with a shared key fields is combined to form a desired result
        Usage preparation
            make files with a shared key
                cut -f 1,1 distros-by-date.txt > distros-name.txt
                paste distros-dates.txt distros-names.txt > distros-key-names.txt

                cut -f 2,2 distros-by-date.txt > distros-vernums.txt
                paste distros-dates.txt distros-vernums.txt > distros-key-vernums.txt
        Usage
            join distros-key-names.txt distros-key-vernums.txt | head
